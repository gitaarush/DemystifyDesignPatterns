# Awesome Software Design Patterns Reference 

A working example for explaining the design patterns in C#


## BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS

### (I) Strategy Pattern

- Uses composition over inheritance that gives more usability
- Programs with interfaces, not implementation (provides runtime behavior changes)
- Delegates the behavior to other classes which encapsulates the family of algorithm

### (II) Observer Pattern

- Pattern where the changes in the subject (Observable) will notify the observers
- Hollywood Principle (Don't call us, we'll call you)
- Widely used patterns ie. Notifications, chatrooms, Feeds, Stock app, etc are very susceptible to this pattern, where
 any changes in the property of the subject will be broadcasted to all users/followers
- Observables has zero to many observers relations
